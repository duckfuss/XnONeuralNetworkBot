# XnONeuralNetworkBot

- uses an MLP (written from scratch) to play noughts and crosses via CLI
- works well on a 3x3 grid for 3 in a row
  - whilst NxM sized grids for L in a row are supported, the simple MLP struggles to solve this
- there is also no pickling, the program must train before you can play
